## Purpose
Desktop Icon to launch Office 365 PowerShell


## Description
Check this video out to see a Desktop Icon that launches PowerShell and automatically logs in to your Office 365 Tenant URL.   It leverages both the SPO (TechNet) and PNP (GitHub) cmdlets to open two connections.   From here, you can easily work on your O365 tenant without having to memorize login steps and repeat each time.  From blog post -
